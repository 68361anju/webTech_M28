                <td>In 1609 CE, in the Aravali Mountains at Bhairavakona, in the aftermath of a fierce battle.
                     Near the edge of a cliff, a dying princess, Mithravindha Devi, pleads with the warrior
                      Kaala Bhairava to confess his love for her. Just as Bhairava begins to express his
                       feelings, she falls, and Bhairava jumps after her, trying to reach her but failing.
                        A Muslim general retrieves his armour and declares that Bhairava will be reborn to
                         reclaim his lost love.
Four hundred years later, in 2009, Harsha, a street-bike racer, briefly touches the hand of a woman trying to
 board his auto, triggering strange visions. Curious, he searches for her and unknowingly asks Indira "Indu"
  about her, not realising she is the same woman. Believing he is stalking her, Indu misleads him and, along
   with her friends, exploits him for favours. However, after Harsha defends her from harassers, she begins 
   to develop feelings for him.
Indu's father, Pratap Varma, was evicted from their ancestral estate in Rajasthan by Omdev, his late sister’s
 husband, who had no rightful claim to the property. The man and his son, Raghuveer, murder several lawyers 
 to maintain control of the estate before travelling to Hyderabad to kill Pratap. However, upon seeing Indu,
  Raghuveer becomes infatuated with her. When his father dismisses his obsession, Raghuveer kills him and manipulates
   Indu and Pratap into believing he died of natural causes. He subsequently offers them the estate in an attempt to gain their trust.
One night, while attempting to touch a sleeping Indu, Raghuveer experiences visions of a warrior slitting his
 throat. Seeking answers, he consults a tantric, Ghora, who reveals that in a past life, he was a prince who lusted after
  Indu and was killed by her lover, a warrior. Meanwhile, Harsha discovers Indu’s deception and pranks her in retaliation, 
  leading them to fall in love. Determined to eliminate his past-life enemy, Raghuveer learns that Harsha is the warrior’s reincarnation. 
  He murders Pratap, frames Harsha, manipulates Indu and takes her away in a helicopter. Harsha fails to stop them and falls into a lake,
   where he experiences visions of his past life.
In 1609, the kingdom of Udaigarh, ruled by King Vikram Singh, face an impending invasion by Emperor Sher Khan. The kingdom’s 
bravest warrior, Kaala Bhairava (Harsha), is secretly in love with Vikram Singh’s daughter, Yuvarani Mithravindha Devi (Indu),
 who reciprocates his feelings. However, Bhairava refrains from expressing his love. Ranadev Billa (Raghuveer), son of Vikram Singh's
  late sister and the royal general, desires to marry Mithra. He arranges a duel with Bhairava, declaring that the winner will marry
   her and the loser will be banished. Bhairava wins, leading to Ranadev's exile. Vikram Singh later persuades Bhairava to reject Mithra’s 
   love, fearing that he will die in battle, leaving her widowed. Bhairava, though heartbroken, complies.

Bhairava takes Mithra, his soldiers, and caretakers to Bhairavakona Temple atop a cliff to seek Lord Shiva's blessings before battle. Mithra 
urges Bhairava to confess his love, but when he remains silent, she disrupts the puja and paints his image with her blood. An injured soldier 
arrives with news that Ranadev has allied with Khan’s army, and has killed Vikram Singh and is advancing toward them. Khan challenges Bhairava
 to kill 100 of his soldiers. Bhairava succeeds but is severely wounded. Impressed by his bravery, Khan has a change of heart and befriends him. However, 
 Ranadev insists on continuing the battle and fatally stabs Mithra before Bhairava beheads him. As Mithra dies, she asks Bhairava to confess his love, but before he 
 can, she falls off the cliff. Devastated, Bhairava jumps after her, embracing the same fate.

In the present, Harsha is rescued by Solomon (Sher Khan’s reincarnation) and learns that Indu’s past-life memories must be revived within the day, or she will remain with
 Raghuveer forever. With Solomon’s help, he kidnaps Indu and takes her to the now-ruined Bhairavakona Temple. In the struggle, Raghuveer accidentally kills Ghora. Harsha 
 tries to convince Indu of their past love, but she does not believe him. Raghuveer arrives by helicopter and urges Indu to leave with him, but she sees Mithra’s painting, 
 triggering her past-life memories. She reunites with Harsha and asks for his forgiveness. Furious, Raghuveer attacks Harsha, who overpowers him. As the duel intensifies, Raghuveer’s 
 henchmen try to push Harsha off the cliff using the helicopter, but Solomon destroys it with his car. Realising he cannot have Indu, Raghuveer attempts to drag her off the cliff with him,
  but Harsha severs his right hand. Raghuveer falls to his death, and Harsha and Indu finally reunite.</td>
