                <td>Vicky, a businessman running a video game development company, lives in Australia and never compromises in his life, a principle that he adheres to since his childhood. He believes that one should be oneself in a relationship and one should not change one's characteristics or personality to get along with his/her partner. He also encourages his friends to follow his principle of life, but his principles and attitude lead to a clash of interests with his father, who constantly advises him to adjust for his and others' happiness. Unfortunately, Vicky pays no heed.

Meanwhile, in India, Vicky's parents arrange a wedding alliance between him and Priya. Priya is Vicky's childhood friend and a doctor by profession. She and Vicky are poles apart; while Vicky is modern in his thinking and is not ready to compromise with his life, Priya is traditional and conservative and is ready to compromise for the happiness of others. Initially, Vicky and Priya do not get along - they both play practical jokes on one another, but later, on her father's advice, Priya attempts to change her attitude towards Vicky and be more positive about him. Soon enough, Priya falls in love with Vicky and changes many of her interests to adjust with him, such as giving up her love of classical dance as Vicky does not like it, eating non-vegetarian food, and wearing modern dresses. Vicky too begins to fall in love with her and is ready to accept the wedding proposal. He receives the news of his friend Shiva's divorce where the relationship soured due to too many compromises. Vicky is very disturbed when he begins to find out that Priya has compromised for his sake. He rejects the proposal and returns to Australia.

Back in Australia, Vicky is matched up through a Cadbury survey (Made for each other), with Maggie, a free-spirited modern girl who shares his no-compromise attitude. Both meet at a mall and, interested in each other, begin to date and soon decide to get married. However, Maggie's father is none other than Dubey, the brother of the CEO of MindGames, who both got into a tiff over business with Vicky in the past. He is unwilling to let Vicky marry Maggie. After much persuasion from Vicky, Dubey agrees to let Vicky marry Maggie on the condition that he should stay in his house for four days for Maggie's sister's wedding and if Vicky manages to win over at least two of Maggie's relatives, he can marry her and he would get a business in India; else, he should forget Maggie and leave the contract. However Vicky insists that if even one relative of Maggie does not get convinced that Vicky is the correct match for Maggie, then he would forget Maggie and leave the contract.

Soon, the relatives begin pouring in from India and among them, to Vicky's shock, is Priya, who happens to be the groom's cousin. During the four days, with Priya's help, he manages to win over the entire family. It is clear that Vicky is going to win Dubey's challenge. But during the challenge he realises that he has compromised by losing a game to reconcile two brothers, ate sweets, etc. Priya leaves for India on the night before Vicky wins the challenge, heartbroken at the thought of Vicky marrying someone else. Vicky receives a message Priya had recorded prior to him rejecting her on his mobile phone where she had declared her love for him. He has a change of heart and realizes how much Priya had loved him and was willing to change for him, in spite of his faults. He also realizes the need for compromise in life. Vicky conveys his feelings to all the wedding guests present and decides not to marry Maggie. Maggie understands and accepts his decision.

Vicky returns to India to win back Priya. But Priya and her family members playfully ignore his attempts. After initially playing hard-to-get, Priya accepts Vicky's love, and they live happily after.</td>
