                <td>Atthili Satthi Babu indulges in thievery with his uncle Duvva Abbulu in Hyderabad; he chances upon Neeraja Goswami, a resident of Devgarh, Madhya Pradesh in a wedding she has come to attend. He flirts with Neeraja, he pinched her waist to which she moans but pretended as if she doesn't like it. Satthi Babu admits his profession and promises to abandon robbing for good but resolves to exploit one last person to amass a massive amount of money. In the railway station, Satthi Babu and Abbulu deceive a woman, who entrusts them with a trunk they flee with. Mahanti, a police official, inspects the trunk and in it, he discovers Neha, a young girl, who presumes Satthi Babu to be her father; as Mahanti uncovers a portrait of Neha with Satthi Babu, he believes her and compels Satthi Babu to look after the child and tells him that he would keep monitoring them. As Satthi Babu unsuccessfully attempts to get rid of her, he perpetually resists Neeraja from stumbling upon the child.

Eventually, Satthi Babu empathises with Neha and begins to care for her; Neeraja and her parents overhear Neha addressing Satthi Babu as her father. Assuming that Satthi Babu has been deceiving her despite being the father of a daughter, Neeraja ends their relationship and departs. Later, goons attack Satthi Babu and Neha, misinterpreting the former to be Vikram Singh Rathore IPS, Neha's father and Satthi Babu's doppelgänger. Mahanti, Sub-inspector Razia (the woman who was carrying the trunk) and a few other police officials come to their rescue but they are overpowered. Subsequently, Vikram arrives to protect his daughter and Satthi Babu and kills all the goons but is severely wounded. In the hospital, Mahanti narrates Vikram's past to Satthi Babu and Abbulu.

In a flashback, Vikram receives his posting in Devgarh and relocates with Neha, his motherless daughter; he is introduced to his colleagues Mahanti and Razia. The inhabitants of Devgarh are tormented in the cruel reign of MLA Bavuji, a psychopath who carries out corruption, money laundering and several other illegal activities. His son Munna abducts Mahanti's wife and keeps molesting her. When Vikram discovers this, he rushes to rescue her and apprehends Munna, ignorant of Bavuji's influence. However, Bavuji is assisted by Home Minister. The DGP, succumbing to the Home Minister's pressure, warns Vikram of consequences, berating his fearlessness but he comes up with an intelligent answer and refuses to back off. Munna is proclaimed mentally unstable and acquitted of all the charges. A party is organised to celebrate his release and Vikram and his team are deputed to secure Munna during the party. Under the pretext of a game, Munna humiliates a police officer and forces him to disrobe himself but Rathore prompts him to slip due to bullets and hang to a belt, killing him. On Holi, Titla, Bavuji's brother, stabs Vikram under the guise of an idol and shoots him as he tries to protect a trapped kid. He is presumed to be dead but survives and sustains an injury in the brain. The villagers conceal his survival and he is moved to Hyderabad for treatment. To keep Neha in the dark about her father's condition, the police officials direct her to Satthi Babu upon discovering that he is Vikram's doppelgänger.

Presently, the doctors declare Vikram dead and everyone chooses to keep it hidden from Neha, who still believes Satthi Babu to be her father. To avenge Vikram's death, Satthi Babu returns to Devgarh, poses as Vikram and targets Bavuji. Abbulu and others reveal the truth to Neeraja, who apologises to Satthi Babu & reconciles with him and agrees to take care of Neha alongside him. Satthi Babu sets fire to Bavuji's wine factory and directs the villagers to rob his food storage. He defeats Bavuji's men and has him beaten up. Titla kidnaps Neha and Neeraja but Satthi Babu fights him and hangs him to death. Having settled scores, Satthi Babu leaves for a new life with Neeraja, Neha and Abbulu.</td>
